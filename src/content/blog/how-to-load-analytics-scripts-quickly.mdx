Here's my previous blog post tested in Lighthouse. It's perfect on the desktop. 

However there's a lot of images so the score is just 97%. 

Lets see if we can improve this. 
```html
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';

export default defineConfig({
  experimental: {
   assets: true
  }
});
```
We will use Astro's experimental image

Let's Party!

<Blockquote name="Astro Docs">
 Partytown is a lazy-loaded library to help relocate resource intensive scripts into a web worker, and off of the main thread.

If you’re using third-party scripts for things like analytics or ads, Partytown is a great way to make sure that they don’t slow down your site.
