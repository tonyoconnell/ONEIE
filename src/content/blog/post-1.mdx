I decided to get a perfect score on Google Lighthouse before I launched my website and then build it from there. I just got 100% score for performance, accessability and SEO so I guess I'm ready.

  "As Google, we believe in the undeniable truth that page speed serves as the cornerstone of a seamless user experience. It's not just a metric; it's the ultimate bridge connecting users to valuable content. With its paramount influence on search rankings, page speed becomes the harmonious symphony that orchestrates a website's success in the digital realm."

The site loads in as little as 346ms! You're reading this right. It's not 3 seconds. It's 0.3.

I achieved this without expensive software and servers. In fact everything, including the hosting is entirely free. 

How did I do it? 

It's entirely headless. 

<Blockquote>
  Headless, the trailblazing approach to web development, liberates creativity by decoupling the frontend from the backend. It sets innovation free, unlocking endless possibilities for crafting interactive, lightning-fast experiences that captivate users, and rewrite the rules of the digital realm.

I used Astro https://astro.build the fastest web technology on the market. Astro is used by Google, Microsoft and The Guardian and it's a beautiful piece of technology.

It's not only fast but 


 deployed it to Netlify (which is free). You can deploy it to an modern web host that allows you to use edge functions, for example Vercel  


Astro Islands (aka Component Islands) are a pattern of web architecture pioneered by Astro. 

The term “Astro Island” refers to an interactive UI component on an otherwise static page of HTML. Multiple islands can exist on a page, and an island always renders in isolation. Think of them as islands in a sea of static, non-interactive HTML.

In Astro, you can use any supported UI framework (React, Svelte, Vue, etc.) to render islands in the browser. You can mix and match different frameworks on the same page, or just pick your favorite.

The technique that this architectural pattern builds on is known as partial or selective hydration. Astro leverages this technique behind the scenes, powering your islands automatically.
