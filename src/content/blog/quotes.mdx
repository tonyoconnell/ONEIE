hatbots are about to embark on a massive growth trajectory that will transform the retailing industry. Most of the transformation will come from costs savings rather than revenue growth, as chatbots likely will draw away sales from other marketing channels, Juniper said.

Tom Leighton, COO of Sofary, had to say:

“Chatbots are a great way for large ecommerce businesses such as ours to reach new customers. Chatbots allow you to reach out to your customers in a way that’s customizable. It can be a lot more cost-effective than traditional marketing strategies. The best chatbots use artificial intelligence to understand your customers’ needs. By doing so, they can provide relevant information when they ask for it.”



“Another major benefit of using chatbots is that it gives us many opportunities to upsell. ,” adds Chris from Highline Wellness. “We’re also able to offer consumers more personalized experiences. That in turn boosts our retention rates. It also increases the likelihood that our customers will refer us to others.”

Ecommerce chatbots collect a wealth of data. This includes data about customer queries, behavior, engagement, sentiment, and interactions. This gives you valuable insights about why customers are, and what they value.

This helps retailers improve their website, visitor experience, and support.
